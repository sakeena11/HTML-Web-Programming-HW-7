	<p>
		On December 31, 2019, China notified the World Health Organization (WHO) of an unknown pneumonia in the Hubei province in Wuhan. The symptoms included persistent fever, <br>
		cough, and dyspnea, and was then named Coronavirus Disease 2019, or COVID-19. The disease spread rapidly from Hubei province to other provinces in China within 2 weeks. <br>
		By November 14, 2020, there were a total of 92,409 COVID-19 cases and 4749 deaths in China. Less than 17% of the cases and less than 4% of the deaths occurred outside   <br>
		of the Hubei province.  <br><br>
		
		Starting January 13 2020, Thailand and more than 200 countries, including Japan, Korea, the United States, and the United Kingdom, reported imported COVID-19 cases. Due <br>
		to the speed and scale of transmission, the WHO described COVID-19 as a pandemic in March 2020 and officially declared it as a global epidemic.

	<p> 
		After the WHO declared COVID-19 as a global pandemic, the U.S. declares is as a national emergency and a Stay-At-Home order is issued. A mask mandate and guidelines are <br>
		also issues to decrease the spread of COVID-19. Hospitals start becoming filled with an overwhelming amount of COVID-19 patients, so the CARES Act is passed, which provides <br>
		$2 trillion in aid to hospitals, small businesses, as well as state and local governments. <br><br>
		
		Cases begin to rise, and trials continue in attempting to find and develop drugs to help treat COVID-19, as well vaccines to prevent against the virus. In May 2020, the U.S. <br>
		unemployment rate reaches 14.7%, which is the worst rate since the Great Depression. During the same month, the Coronavirus death toll surpasses 100,000 in the U.S. In <br>
		September 2021, the death rate in the U.S. surges to 200,000, and increased outbreaks continuing occurring due to large holiday gatherings. <br><br>

		December, death rates surpase 300,000, and the Moderna vaccine is authorized for individuals 18 and older. In February 2021, the one shot Johnson & Johnson vaccine is <br>
		authorized, but paused again in June 2021 due to concerns about blood clotting. At the end of June, the CDC continued recommending the Johnson & Johnson vaccine for <br>
		individuals 18 and older. <br><br>

	<p> 
		Mid January 2021, 400,000 COVID-19 cases is surpassed in the U.S. 100 million Covid-19 cases is surpassed worldwide, and in February, the U.S. COVID-19 death rate reaches <br>
		500,000. In June 2021, the Delta variant is first discovered in India, and cases start to increase again. This causes restrictions to be raised again in attempt to stop the <br>
		spread of the Delta variant. <br><br>
		
		In late 2021, a study is released that shows that more than 140,000 U.S. children under the age of 18 years lost a primary caregiver who provided <br>
		the childâ€™s home and basic needs during the pandemic. The WHO also classifies a new variant named Omicron that was first found in South Africa.

	<p> 
		To date worldwide, there are about 300 million total COVID-19 cases and about 5 million total deaths. 2 million new COVID-19 cases. In the U.S., there have been about 70 million <br>
		total cases and 900,000 deaths in a population of about 300 million people. Cases were declining, but started to increase again late December 2021 due to the Omicron variant. <br><br>
		
		Masks will be around for the new future to prevent the spread of the coronavirus as much as possible. In the U.S., many states are opening back up and allowing schools and work <br>
		to continue in person. Many states are still upholding the mask mandate, and recommend individuals to stay home and get tested if they feel ill.
